# Snake-Game
Inspired by the classic 1998 Nokia Snake game, this modern take lets players control a green snake as it slithers around a grid-based screen, hunting for randomly spawning apples. Each apple eaten makes the snake longer — and the challenge greater. Avoid crashing into the screen’s edges or your own tail, or it’s game over!

## Controls-
- W / Up Arrow : Move up
- A / Left Arrow : Move left
- S / Down Arrow : Move down
- D / Right Arrow : Move right
